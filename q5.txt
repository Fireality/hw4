1. Variable "a" won't change after undergoing function incrememnt_int_a. 
2. Variable "b" will increment as the function increment_int_b intended. 
3. This is because variable "b" is a list, therefore it is modifiable after the list is defined. However, "a" will
revert back to its original value after the function.
